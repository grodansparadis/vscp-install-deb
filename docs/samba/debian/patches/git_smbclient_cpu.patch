Subject: [PATCH] async_req: make async_connect_send() "reentrant"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Allow callers to pass in socket fds that where already passed to an
earlier call of async_connect_send(). Callers expect this behaviour and
it was working until 05d4dbda8357712cb81008e0d611fdb0e7239587 broke it.

The proper fix would be to change callers to close the fd and start from
scratch with a fresh socket.
