      same setting.
  * Include ntlm_auth.1 and smbd.8 man pages in the samba package.

  * Install /usr/bin/setntacl manually; the upstream install target doesn't
    seem to do it anymore.
  * Ask for the realm (and give it to the upgrade script) when upgrading from

  * New upstream version.

  * Add sections to binary packages to match the archive:
    * libparse-pidl-perl: perl

  * Adjust our export procedure we get the Subversion revision number in

    README.building.
  * Remove "reload" option from the init script, since Samba 4 doesn't
    understand SIGHUP yet.

  * Replace debconf dependencies with ${misc:Depends}, to automatically

  * Include the newuser binary in samba-server package.
  * Add missing Build-Depends on: libgnutls-dev, libreadline5-dev,

    was simply built without the features).
  * Remove Build-Depends on libldap-dev.

samba (3.9.0+SVN12739-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Move /usr/lib/samba/setup from samba-common to samba.
    * Make samba replace samba-common (<= 3.9.0+SVN12726-1)
  * Add a missing db_stop in samba.postinst, probably causing problems
    starting the daemon in some cases.
  * Add orphan files from /usr/bin (and relevant manpages) into their
    correct packages:
    * ldb-tools: ldbrename, ldbtest, oLschema2ldif.
    * samba: ntlm_auth.
    * samba-clients: getntacl.
    * samba-gtk-frontends: gwcrontab.
    * winregistry-tools: winreg.
    * samba3dump and tdbtorture remain orphans.
  * Add new executable /usr/bin/testparm to samba package.
    * Add /var/lib/samba directory to samba package; it's needed by
      testparm.
  * Rewrite configuration/bootstrapping to be able to install the client
    only and still get a usable smb.conf. The basic idea is:
    * samba-common looks for an smb.conf. If there is none, it asks for
      realm and domain and generates a skeleton smb.conf.
    * If samba notices an upgrade from Samba 3, it asks whether the user
      wants to upgrade. If not, it leaves everything alone (and broken).
    * Otherwise, samba asks whether the user wants to set up a PDC. If yes,
      it adds "server role = pdc" to smb.conf and provisions the server.
  * Removed unused file samba.conffiles.
  * Run dh_installdebconf on architecture-independent packages as well, now
    that samba-common has a config script.
  * Let samba-clients conflict/replace samba-common (<< 3.9.0), as they share
    /usr/bin/net.

samba (3.9.0+SVN12726-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian main.

  * Package renaming to get more in line with Samba 3 packaging:
    * Rename samba-server package to just samba, for consistency with the
      Samba 3 packaging.
      * Rename samba.samba.init to samba.init, now that the init script and the
        server package are called the same.
    * Rename samba-swat to swat, and add a dependency from swat to samba.

  * debian/rules changes:
    * Change SOURCEPATH to reflect that we now have the packaging in debian/,
      not packaging/debian/. This will have to be reverted whenever upstream
      syncs with us.
    * Removed debmake comment, it's hardly relevant any more.
    * Removed comment that there aren't any architecture-independent packages
      (because there are).
    * Remove redundant "package=samba" variable.
    * Do "make pch ; make all" instead of "make proto ; -make pch ; make all";
      some build system bug prevents us from just doing "make pch all", but
      since we're more or less guaranteed a recent gcc version, the pch target
      shouldn't fail, so we won't allow it to.
    * Remove autogen.sh call from configure; it should be done in the
      upstream tarball, not in maintainer scripts.

  * debian/control changes:
    * Copied Uploaders: line from Samba 3 packaging, adding myself.
    * Rename samba-client package to samba-clients.
    * Make samba-clients Replaces/Conflicts smbclient.
    * Build-depend on docbook-xml, not just docbook-xsl -- the documentation
      needs data from both to build.
    * Move the samba binary package to the top, so it's the one receiving
      the README.* files, among others.

  * Maintainer script changes:
    * Attempt to upgrade from Samba 3 if that's what the user tries to do.
      * Copy upgrade script into /usr/lib/samba/setup.
      * Check for upgrade from << 3.9.0 in config, and ask the user for upgrade
        if relevant.
      * Check for upgrade from << 3.9.0 in postinst, and upgrade if the user
        wished to.
    * Only provision in samba.postinst if we're doing a fresh install.
    * Support purging properly in postrm, both for samba and samba-common
      (adapted from the Samba 3 packaging).
    * Don't ask about an administrator password -- just let the provisioning
      scripts make up a random one.
      * Updated README.Debian to show the user how to change the password.
      * Make samba recommend ldb-tools.
    * Install README.building along with all the other documentation.
    * Don't try to ask about the "done" question, which we nuked in a previous
      release.

  * Updated debian/copyright.
    * Added Samba copyright holders.
    * Noted that talloc, ldb and tdb are under the LGPL.
    * Added copyright holders and licensing for the packaging itself.

  * Remove a few unused files in the packaging.
  * Change debhelper compatibility level to 5.
    * Update versioned depends accordingly.
  * Don't give --pidfile to start-stop-daemon when stopping -- current
    versions of Samba 4 won't die when the parent is killed.
  * Updated README.debian somewhat, and renamed to use a capital D.
  * Rewritten README.building, to reflect the magic that has to be done
    with the package in another repository.
  * Update po/POTFILES.in to reflect name change (from samba4-server ->
    samba-server -> samba).

  * Turkish debconf translation update (Atila KOÇ).  Closes: #672447
  * Drop the code that generates an smbpasswd file from the system's
    user list. This adds very long delays on systems with many users,
    including those with external user backends. It also makes much
    less sense nowadays and the use of libpam-smbpass can easily
    fill most of the needs. Closes: #671926
  * Merged from Ubuntu:
    - Set 'usershare allow guests', so that usershare admins are 
      allowed to create public shares in addition to authenticated
      ones.
    - add map to guest = Bad user, maps bad username to guest access.
    This allows for anonymous user shares. Closes: #672497

samba (2:3.5.11~dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't export DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS in debian/rules, this is only used locally.
  * Use dh_links instead of manually creating directories and symlinks from
    debian/rules.
  * Switch from dh_movefiles to dh_install and adjust for debhelper compat
    level 7, in preparation for moving to dh(1).
  * Where possible, use dh_installman and dh_install's support for target
    directories instead of moving files around in debian/rules.
  * We don't need to mess with perms on usr/include/libsmbclient.h anymore
    in debian/rules, the upstream install target gets it right
  * Use debian/clean instead of removing left-behind files by hand in the
    clean target
  * Convert debian/rules to dh(1).
  * Don't run debconf-updatepo on clean; not worth the divergence in
    debian/rules anymore :)
  * Don't install debian/README.build in the package; this is really only
    relevant in the source.
  * Bump to debhelper compat level 9 and build libraries for multiarch.
  * Drop Makefile.internal from libsmbclient-dev examples so that we can mark
    libsmbclient-dev Multi-Arch: same.
  * Bump build-depends on debhelper to 8.9.4, so we ensure we have
    dpkg-buildflags by default and get full build hardening enabled out of
    the box - critical for a server like samba.
  * Use DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE instead of passing override options to
    dh_installexamples.
  * Pass --sourcedirectory=source3 to dh instead of having to pass it to each
    dh_auto_* command.
  * Ironically, this means that we have to manually disable dh_auto_test,
    which now finds the makefile targets but doesn't work unless we build an
    extra wrapper library into our binaries that we don't want.
  * Drop a few configure options from debian/rules that shadow the built-in
    defaults.
  * debian/libsmbclient.lintian-overrides: yes, we know the package name
    doesn't match the soname - and it never should until there's an ABI
    change.

    - debian/samba{,-common}.prerm: don't call update-alternatives --remove
      on upgrade, /do/ call it on other invocations of the prerm script.  If
      these tools ever go away, the removal needs to be handled on upgrade by
      the maintainer scripts of the new package version.
    - debian/samba{,-common-bin}.postinst: call update-alternatives
      unconditionally, don't second-guess the maintainer script arguments.
    - debian/samba.postinst: call update-alternatives after the debconf
      handling, not before; debconf triggers a re-exec of the script so
      anything done before invoking debconf is wasted because it will be
      re-done, and if there's already a debconf frontend running when this
      is called, the not-redirected update-alternatives output will confuse
      it.  Closes: #558116.

      that owns these binaries.

  * Drop some further code in samba-common.postinst that's specific to

  * Make the mount.smbfs wrapper a bash script instead of a POSIX sh script,

    Thanks to Martin Michlmayr for helping to pin down the problem file.

    - add a new target, "update-archs", to be invoked by hand to refresh
      the list of known Linux architectures for the libacl1-dev
      build-dep; this avoids the clean target making changes to

  * On Ubuntu, support autopopulating the sambashare group using the existing
    members of the admin group; no equivalent handling is done on Debian,

    system popt lib instead of the bundled one.

  * Urgency set to high for a bug that makes smbclient/libsmbclient
    /almost/ mostly unusable

      spin off into infinity and clobber the system (closes: #274969).
    - Make sure we use C-locale toupper/tolower functions for case
      conversion, since Turkish pairing rules are incompatible
      (closes: #286174).
  * Fix logrotate script to exit true instead of false when nmbd.pid is
    missing (closes: #287263).

  * High-urgency upload for sarge-targetted RC bugfix.  
  * Sync the fhs.patch to samba 3.0.10.
  * Install mount.cifs suid root, to make user mounts possible
    (closes: #283819).
  * debian/patches/cups.patch: Change the default printing system, so we
    can compile in CUPS support without making it the default -- CUPS is
    not a reasonable default on Debian, at least for sarge.

  * Fix for the legacy ldapsam_compat backend; thanks to Fabien
    Chevalier for the patch (closes: #274155).

samba (3.0.8-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream package. Urgency set to "high" because of a potential
    Denial of Service vulnerability in previous 3.0.x releases
    (CAN-2004-0930). (Eloy)
  * Introduce new -dbg package, so we can make better sense out of the
    cleverly-supplied backtrace emails. (Vorlon)
  * Applied patch from Luke Mewburn <luke@mewburn.net> to fix missing
    lock_path() to state_path() change in the FHS patches. (Eloy)

samba (3.0.7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Use autogen.sh in unpatch-source as well as in patch-source, to get
    rid of the autom4te.cache cruft.
  * debian/patches/make-distclean.patch: add some missing files to the
    distclean target in source/Makefile.in (mostly-fixes: #276203).
  * Change compile-time default of 'use sendfile' to 'no', since the
    current Samba implementation is broken (closes: #261917, #275741,
    #270175).
  * Add mount.cifs into the smbfs package; thanks to Igor Belyi for
    showing us just how simple this patch should be. ;)  Since cifs is
    the preferred kernel driver in 2.6, bugs related to smbfs and 2.6
    are considered closed unless someone can show that they exist with
    the cifs driver as well (closes: #249890, #269443, #227791, #236869,
    #260707, #261808, #270175).
  * Fix FHS migration code so that it only affects upgrades from old
    package versions, and doesn't cause us to mess with non-standard
    directories that may have been re-added by the admin
   (closes: #251858).

samba (3.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release. This release fixes two possible denial of
    service conditions; one in nmbd and one in smbd. The CVE numbers
    for these vulnerabilities are:

    CAN-2004-0807 for the smbd DoS
    CAN-2004-0808 for the nmbd DoS

    Urgency is set to "high" because of these vulnerabilities; so this
    new release propagates to testing ASAP.

    Thanks to the Samba Team and the Debian Security Team for the
    heads up.
  * Remove post-3.0.6 patches that are now in 3.0.7.

    + Can't list share files/dirs, but can acces deeper files/dirs
      (closes: #264572)
    + Samba 3.0.5 Printserver doesn't work with WinXP SP2 (closes: #265871)
  * Urgency "high" to make it into testing as soon as possible since
    at least #265871 is pretty bad now that WinXP SP2 has been released.
    Thanks for the help Fabien! Both Vorlon and I have been very busy
    lately.

samba (3.0.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

    Aleix Badia i Bosch <abadia@ica.es> and the Debian L10n Catalan Team.
    (closes: #236640)
  * Incorporate Czech debconf translations; thanks to
    Miroslav Kure <kurem@upcase.inf.upol.cz> (closes: #236274).
  * Update libsmbclient shlibs, due to an incompatibility with older
    versions that prevents gnome-vfs from working correctly

  * Apply patch from Urban Widmark <urban@teststation.com> to prevent
    users from mounting remote filesystems containing suid files
    (closes: 232327).  This represents an exploitable security hole on
    systems running Linux 2.6 kernels.

samba (3.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    - LaMont Jones: correct false failure LFS test that resulted
      in _GNU_SOURCE not being defined (thus resulting in strndup()
      not being defined) (closes: #226694)
    - Segfault fixes. (closes: #230012) (maybe more, but we need bug
      reporters to confirm.)

    Urgency "high" due to a password initialization bug that could grant
    an attacker unauthorized access to a user account created by the
    mksmbpasswd.sh shell script. See WHATSNEWS.txt for details and
    workarounds for those not wishing to upgrade (which is a bad idea
    anyway since this new release fixes lots of other bugs.)

samba (3.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't create directories outside of the source directory during
    package build time. (closes: #227221, #227238, #225862)
  * Don't include the "Using Samba" book in the swat package, just a
    symlink that points to the book included in the samba-doc package.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Jan 2004 13:48:13 -0500

samba (3.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support in the dhcp hook for netbios scope, and handle better
    the case of multiple DHCP-using interfaces (closes: #224109).
  * Use "tail -n 1 ..." instead of "tail -1 ..." so POSIX-compliant
    tail works. Thanks to Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>.
  * Include /usr/bin/ntlm_auth in the winbind package.
  * Run configure with "--with-piddir=/var/run/samba" since the
    default got changed to /var/run in this new upstream version.

    - Fixes use of non-PIC code in nss shared libraries (closes: #208773)
    - 'unix password sync' option now runs the unix password program as

samba (3.0.0beta2+3.0.0rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (skipped samba 3.0.0beta3 due to time
    constraints.) This ugly version number will go away when the final
    Samba 3.0.0 is released.
  * Drag new unpackaged tools into the packages: smbcquotas (smbclient),
    vfs modules (samba), smbtree(1) manpage (smbclient), tdbbackup(8)
    manpage (samba). (closes: #151158)
  * Switch to DH_COMPAT level 4:
    - no explicit conffile listings needed
    - the postinst for libsmbclient is now completely autogenerated
    - use the default init script handling (with support for
      invoke-rc.d) in debhelper, instead of the currently buggy upgrade
      path (closes: #185439)
    - add support for ${misc:Depends} in control for those packages with
      init scripts
  * Add versioned dependency on libpam-runtime and change
    /etc/pam.d/samba to use the new common PAM config blocks.
  * New python2.3-samba package (old python2.2-samba is no more.)
    (closes: #206171)

  * New upstream release
    - The smb.conf(5) manpage documents config options again

      should be able to map domain accounts to local accounts again
      (closes: #196815).
    - Use the locale charset for 'display charset' by default
      (closes: #194406).
    - Fix for segfault in smbclient when using the -b option
      (closes: #196833).
    - Handle an empty 'passdb backend' list gracefully (closes: #193946).
  * Don't set 'display charset' anymore on upgrade, since this is now
    grabbed from the locale by default -- a much better option.
  * Removed time.c.patch which is now in the upstream sources.
  * Update FHS patch for two new tdb files (netsamlogon_cache.tdb,
    privilege.tdb).
  * Remove python-linker.patch, since the Kerberos package has been
    fixed to no longer use rpath
  * Remove configure.patch: the hppa glibc bug this was added for is
    long since fixed, and upstream isn't interested in supporting this
    kludge.
  * Update references to missing documentation in sample smb.conf file
    (closes: #187632).
  * Fix handling of krb5 link line, building on a patch from Stefan
    Metzmacher <metze@metzemix.de>.
  * Add patch so smbclient's tar support works with popt
    (closes: #194921).

    to make sure we get the right shlib dependencies (closes: #193149).
  * Update the dhcp config hooks so they're suitable for sourcing (i.e.,
    don't call "exit") (closes: #196477).
  * Bring package into line with current policy by adding support for
    the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS flag, and enabling debugging symbols (-gstabs)
    by default
  * Make sure libpam-smbpass is a self-contained DSO.
  * Fix a typo in samba-common.dhcp that caused us to spuriously rewrite
    the server list.
  * Fix python install script to ignore -Wl linker flags, as seen in the
    output from the latest krb5-config.
  * Add LDAP and Unicode information about upgrading from 2.2 to
    README.debian.
  * Remove dangerous and confusing browse options from the default 
    smb.conf (closes: #198804).
  * Reorder smb.conf options for clearer grouping, and clarify the
    comments.
  * Add a default [print$] share to the sample smb.conf, and create the
    necessary tree under /var/lib/samba/printers. (closes: #168173)
  * s/winbind/idmap/ in smb.conf, since the option names have changed.
  * Fix the patch for postexec handling, so that we chdir("/") at the
    right time.

    - WinXP machines can join a Samba-controlled domain again
      (closes: #195362)

  * Move the python package from section "net" to section "python".
  * Make sure we use PIC code for python on all platforms.
  * French translation of an additional debconf template, courtesy of
    Christian Perrier <bubulle@debian.org>. (closes: #188832)
  * Updated Brazilian Portuguese translation from André Luís Lopes
    <andrelop@ig.com.br>.
  * s/unixsam/guest/ everywhere, since the unixsam backend is now
    deprecated. (closes: #190095)
  * Create our temp config file as /etc/samba/smb.conf.dpkg-tmp; not
    only does using /tmp violate SELinux policies, it introduces the
    possibility of data loss during the final copy if /tmp is a separate
    filesystem. (closes: #189823)
  * Pull in fix for SWAT, so that logins work again
    (closes: #188255, #192077).

  * Change shlibs to 0 instead of 0.1.  The library already in the
    archive is using this soname, and there are no packages depending
    on libsmbclient, so skip changing the package name for now.

samba (2.999+3.0.alpha23-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New package python2.2-samba that includes the Python modules
    included in the Samba sources. Feedback on these modules and the new
    package is welcome, as we (Debian Samba maintainers) don't use them.
    (closes: #170731, #173322)
  * Move libsmbclient-dev from section "devel" to "libdevel".
  * Fix panic action script to give a sensible error message instead of
    an empty backtrace when we don't have permission to attach to the
    process. (closes: #188164)
  * Fix libpam-smbpass so that it really does something. (closes: #178245)
  * Apply patch to fix printing-related segfaults. (closes: #188076)

  * updated Brazilian Portuguese templates (closes: #183295)
  * fix a typo in upstream manpage (s/shave/share/) (closes: #180546)

samba (2.999+3.0.alpha21-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * add scripts to samba-common to grab the netbios-name-servers options
    if we're running a DHCP client (closes: #38413)
  * major rearrangement of build scripts: install target now operates on
    debian/tmp, not debian/samba, so we can see when new files are
    added and decide where to put them; several files that should have
    been in samba-common but were in samba (for the above reason) --
    smbcacls, -- have been moved, with a replaces: added.
  * Fix rc script so that whitespace is consistent between inetd and
    daemon modes (closes: #174677).
  * smbclient -M must always connect to port 139, because port 445
    doesn't support messaging and we can't do the port 135 stuff yet
    (closes: #175292, #167859).
  * Import the diff from upstream CVS, which has fixed a few bugs
    (closes: #178219, #177583, #181467, #181487, #181603, #175864).
    Remove a few patches of ours which are now superseded.
  * Add po-debconf support to the tree, for better i18n.
  * Install the libsmbclient.so symlink in the libsmbclient-dev package,
    per policy (closes: #181466).

  * Drop --with-ldapsam from the configure options, since this no longer
    means what we thought it did.  Revert patch for changing the 'passdb
    backend' defaults.
  * Add patch from CVS HEAD to fix pdbedit segfault; postinst script

    Debian Samba packages. (Closes: #165035)
  * Apply patch for segfault in pam_smbpass when using the unixsam
    backend.
  * Drop support for nmbd in inetd, since it's not supported by
    upstream and is reported to cause problems (closes: #23243, #137726,
    165037).
  * Clarify example printing configs in smb.conf (closes: #168174).
  * Make sure nmbd still responds to SIGTERM if it has no interfaces to
    listen on (closes: #168079).
  * Fix to get samba working again on 64-bit archs, after a
    pointer<->int size mismatch bug.  Already fixed in upstream CVS.
  * Merge fix from CVS for broken libsmbclient.h references to internal
    structures (closes: #162956).
  * Add a default 'panic action' for Samba that will give us genuinely
    useful debugging information after a crash.
  * Fixed correct patch to example configurations in the libpam-smbpass
    packages (closes: #169350).
  * acl-dev is not in sid anymore; Build-Depend on libacl1-dev instead
    (closes: #169682).
  * Only ask the user for permission to edit if there's a chance of us
    damaging something.

    as well as when it has not (closes: #164179).  Thank to Robbert Kouprie
    <robbert@radium.jvb.tudelft.nl> for this patch.
  * Not using 'killall' in any of the maintainer scripts (the last one
    remaining was winbind.logrotate.) We now just use 'kill' to send
    a SIGHUP to a specific PID (which is stored in a file in
    /var/run/samba.)

  * fix makefile handling of LOGBASEDIR, so that logs always end up in
    the right place (closes: 153727).
  * Fixed bug in the FHS migration path that causes nmbd to read its

  * move libnss_wins.so to libnss_wins.so.2, where glibc expects to find
    it (closes: #148586).
  * reorder postinst, so that installing samba-common from scratch loads

samba (2.2.4+2.2.5pre1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Getting ready for Samba 2.2.5.
  * Remove patches/parse_spoolss.patch, now included upstream.
  * Fixed thinko WRT POSIX ACL support, which we "half-enabled" in
    2.2.4-1. We don't use POSIX ACL support ourselves, so we'd
    appreciate reports from those using this feature so we can
    be sure this works.
  * Fix the filename-matching algorithm used for smbtar's 'exclude'
    functionality. (closes: #131571)
  * Look for secrets.tdb in /var/lib/samba, and handle in the postinst.
    This is not really a config file, because users don't edit it.
    (closes: #147429)
  * Doxygen fix for libsmbclient.h, thanks to Tommi Komulainen

  * Include samples, exclude INSTALL from libpam-smbpass (closes: #145055)
  * Compile with --with-automount, for NIS homedir support (closes: #123396)
  * Add a proper 'flags' field to the mount entry we write to /etc/mtab;
    fixes a display bug with mount (closes: #140397)
  * Added logic to /etc/init.d/samba so a help message is printed out
    when Samba is running from inetd _and_ we are not booting, i.e. the
    user called the init script manually. Thanks to Francesco
    Potorti <pot@gnu.org> for the suggestion on how to implement this.
    (Closes: #139807, #140204)
  * samba.postinst: added logic so we don't call /etc/init.d/samba if
    we are running from inetd (this prevents the stupid help message
    to be printed during package upgrades if we are running from inetd.)
  * samba.prerm: idem.
  * /etc/init.d/samba: delete stale PID files after nmbd and smbd are
    stopped. This prevents start-stop-daemon from printing an ugly
    error message when called from '/etc/init.d/samba stop'. I prefer
    this than running start-stop-daemon with --oknodo because
    start-stop-daemon might print other important error messages that with
    --oknodo it would otherwise not print. (Closes: #102187, #109301)
  * Patch from jerry@samba.org to fix parsing of spoolss structures.

samba (2.2.3a-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * More README.debian updates.
  * Neutralize the smb.conf 'lock dir' directive, which doesn't mean
    what the FHS says it should, and causes us no end of grief.
    (Closes: #122299)
  * LPRng-handling patch so that jobs printed to recent versions of
    LPRng show up properly as 'done' instead of 'paused' in the Windows
    print queue.  Thanks to Jaroslav Serdula <serdula_jaroslav@vse.sk>
    for this patch. (Closes: #139458)
  * Applied patch from Urban Widmark <urban@teststation.com>
    (smbfs upstream maintainer) to add a '-n' option to smbmount
    that does the same as mount's '-n'. (Closes: #139590)
  * Minor tweak to unpatch-source so we unpatch sources in the
    reverse order we patched them.
  * Don't depend on grep in samba.prerm to determine if Samba was
    running before the upgrade starts.
  * Tweak the wording of debconf templates.
  * Incorporate debconf translations for French, Spanish and Portuguese;
    thanks to Carlos Valdivia Yagüe <valyag@hotpop.com> (es),
    Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@ig.com.br> (pt_BR), and Philippe
    Batailler and Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org> (fr).
    (closes: #142657, #142659, #141551, #141699, #141682)
  * Fixed symlinks in the swat package so the point to /usr/share/doc/
    instead of /usr/doc/. Added note to the description of the
    swat packages that says that samba-doc must be installed for
    the on-line documentation to work. Thanks to Torne Wuff
    <torne@wolfpuppy.org.uk>. (Closes: #95437)
  * 'dh_installinit -n' gives us no initscript handling -- we need to
    handle all starting and stopping of daemons ourselves, which wasn't
    happening in the {pre,post}rm scripts.
  * Vary the priority of the debconf question "Do you want to generate
    /etc/samba/smbpassd?" depending on whether the file already exists.
    File exists -> priority 'medium', file does not exist -> priority
    'low'. Changed priorities of all other questions from 'high' to 'medium'.

    call 'update-inetd --remove' on package purge.
  * Bring our shipped smb.conf closer in line with the upstream
    defaults: don't twiddle the send/recv buffer sizes, since the Linux
    kernel already provides a much better default setting
     (closes: #80966, #80934, #137415, #133477)

samba (2.2.3a-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * merge in debconf support:
    - Moved all smb.conf-related questions to samba-common (smb.conf
      is part of the samba-common package, not the samba package.)
    - smb.conf is not a samba-common conffile anymore since it is
      being managed by debconf. It is ABSOLUTELY necessary to make
      sure /etc/samba/smb.conf _NEVER_ gets overwritten by changes
      made via debconf. In other words, any changes made by the user
      should be honored by the debconf interface.
    - samba.postinst now moves old log files from /var/log/ to
      /var/log/samba/. There's a Debconf note that informs the user
      the log files are stored now in a new location.
    - debian/control:
      + Make samba depend on debconf.
    - New file debian/samba.templates.
    - New file debian/samba.config.
    - Re-worked debian/samba.postinst.
      + Got rid of all /etc/samba/debian_config sillyness.
    - remove /usr/sbin/sambaconfig; "dpkg-reconfigure samba" replaces 
      it.
    - Removed debian/samba.prerm.
    - Cleaned up /etc/init.d/samba.
      + Added infrastructure for debconf.
      + Got rid of all /etc/samba/debian_config sillyness.
      + Got rid of /etc/samba/smbpasswd conversion stuff for
        compatibility with versions of Samba < 2.0.0final-2.
    (closes: #127959, #34408, #113594)

    makes for a clean upgrade path.

  * Potato builds were failing because debian/rules was not creating
    debian/winbind/etc/logrotate.d/. A user having problems creating
    Potato packages brought this to my attention. dh_installlogrotate
    takes care of creating the directory for us, that's why we didn't
    notice.
  * Removed code that converts /etc/samba/smbpasswd from an ancient
    format to the new format of Samba 2.0.0 and later.
    Closes: #134375 - samba: postinst failed due to missing
            /usr/bin/convert_smbpasswd.
  * Re-organized FHS migration code in samba.postinst. Make sure we
    don't fail when we move files that don't exist.
    Closes: #133813 - samba: Install failed.
  * Adding docs. to the libpam-smbpass package.
  * Remove man pages for findsmb because we are not providing this
    script.
    Closes: #134181 - findsmb referenced, but not included.
  * Removed replace.patch because it is now present upstream.
  * Added patch from Jerry Carter to fix a problem when saving
    document preferences for printing from NT clients.
  * The real winbindd daemon is a forked process so we can't use
    --make-pidfile when calling start-stop-daemon. Fixed 
    /etc/init.d/winbind to work around the issue. Thanks to 
    Lin Li <linl@xandros.com> for the patience and for reporting 
    the problems. Hopefully I got it right this time.

      - Use a relative symlink for /usr/lib/cups/backend/smb.
      - Removal of a .cvsignore file in the samba-doc package.
  * winbind.init fixes:
      - Corrected name of the pid file (Steve)
      - Make start-stop-daemon create a pid file for winbindd since it
        does not create one on his own.
  * #DEBHELPER# is not needed in samba.postinst because we are adding
    manually everything that debhelper adds automatically. In fact,
    since we are calling update-rc.d without standard paramaters I
    think we can't use #DEBHELPER#.
  * Fix fatal syntax error in samba.prerm.

samba (2.2.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * work on lintian-cleanness in the package (wrong permissions,
    maintainer scripts in need of debhelpering)
  * /lib/security/pam_smbpass.so is now being included in the
    libpam-smbpass package only, and not in both the libpam-smbpass and
    samba packages (which was the case prior to 2.2.3-3.)
  * Instead of making our patch scripts executable in the rules file
    we run them through /bin/sh.
  * New 'winbind' package that has all the winbind stuff that was in the 
    samba package in 2.2.3-2 and before.
  * Added replace.patch: patch from Jeremy Allison to fix problems when
    replacing or overwriting files in a Samba share. Patch was sent to
    the samba mailing list.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Tue,  5 Feb 2002 21:12:48 -0500

samba (2.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * add support to debian/scripts/{patch-source,unpatch-source} for
    automatic updating and cleaning of <version.h>. This was a request
    from the Samba Team: they wanted us to clearly mark our packages
    so it is always known a user is running Samba with (possibly)
    Debian-specific patches.
  * Change init.d killscript link to K19samba, so we stop before autofs 
    (closes: 117327)
  * Make our patch scripts executable in the rules file -- dpkg won't do 
    this for us (closes: #132415).

  * Use killall -q in logrotate.d script, to avoid spurious cron 
    emails (closes: #130100).

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Feb 2002 19:56:18 -0500

samba (2.2.2-12) unstable; urgency=high

  * (Steve) Patch for source/client/client.c.

  * Uploading with urgency=high to expedite the move from unstable
    to testing because of the security problem fixed in -11.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jan 2002 22:31:12 -0500

samba (2.2.2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Building with --with-libsmbclient. We have created two new
    packages: libsmbclient and libsmbclient-dev. Hopefully this
    will help some people that want to add the capability of
    speaking SMB to their applications.
    Closes: #117132 - libsmbclient support library?
  * (Steve) Make swat do the right thing when reading (parsing)
    the saved preferences in smb.conf.
    Closes: #55617 swat mutilates the linpopup message command.
  * Updated README.Debian. Updated descriptions in debian/control.
  * Remembered to bump up version number in source/include/version.h
    (need to automate this or else I'll keep forgetting.)
  * (Steve) one liner for source/web/diagnose.c.
    Closes: #106976 - smbd/nmbd not running message with swat/linuxconf.
  * Added '|| true' to the post-rotate script so logrotate doesn't
    fail if either nmbd or smbd is not running.
    Closes: #127897 - /etc/logrotate.d/samba fails if there is no smbd process.
  * Fixed incorrect file locations in swat's man page and added a
    Debian-specific note to /usr/share/doc/swat/README.
    Closes: #71586 swat: needs documentation fixes for debian.
  * smbmount in the smbfs package does not have the setuid bit set.
    Apparently, smbmount uses libsmb without checking the environment.
    Thanks to Christian Jaeger <christian.jaeger@sl.ethz.ch> for
    finding the local root exploit.
  * Applied old patch from Jerry) Carter" <jerry@samba.org> to correct
    the following two problems in Samba 2.2.2:
    - %U and %G could not be used in services names
      in smb.conf.
    - %G would fail to be expanded in an "include = ..."
      line.

samba (2.2.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added "Replaces: samba (<= 2.2.2-5)" to the smbclient section in
    debian/control so rpcclient.1, which was in samba-2.2.2-5, does not
    cause problems now that it is part of smbclient (>= 2.2.2-6).  Closes:

  * (Steve) Adds manpage for rpcclient to the proper file,
    removes smbtorture from the distro because this tool isn't intended for
    widespread consumption.
    Closes: #63057 - no manual page for smbtorture.
  * (Steve) Removed -gnu from the configure arguments (--build, --host) in
    debian/rules so config.sub is able to properly create the host and target
    tuples.

    Closes: #118277: /etc/logrotate.d/samba not listed in conffiles.

samba (2.2.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Steve to work around problem in glibc that affects the

    Closes: Bug#126763: samba completely broken on hppa.
  * Including unicode_map.1251.
    Closes: Bug#126719: samba-common: unicode_map.1251 missing.

samba (2.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backed out changes to source/filename.c per Andrew Tridgell's request.
    This changes were introduced in 2.2.1a-7 as an attempt to fix #47493.
    Tridge found out that they break smbd.
  * Changed version number in source/includes/version.h so it is clear that
    this is a version of Samba packaged for Debian. This is another request from
    Tridge and will help the Samba Team to get bogus bug reports.
  * Added Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf and other README files to the
    /usr/share/doc/<package>/ directories.
  * Installing libnss_winbind.so and pam_winbind.so.

samba (2.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Temporary fix for #113763 (Steve Langasek)
  * Quick hack to avoid smbmount reveal password length. Please note
    that even with this hack there is a small window when password is
    completely visible with 'ps aux'. There are other methods that should
    be used to automate mounting of SMB shares.
    Closes: #112195: smbmount-2.2.x reveals password length.
  * Applied patch from Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org> to prevent
    forcing use of setresuid() in Sparc.
    Closes: #112779: samba build forces use of setresuid, which causes
                     smbd to fail on Sparc.

    sgml as well.)
    Closes: #110963: smb.conf: mail should be /usr/bin/mail.
  * Documented better smbclient's -W behavior. Patch from Steve
    Langasek.
    Closes: #53672: smbclient: -W flag is interpreted as domain, not

samba (2.2.1a-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backed out fix to #47493 introduced in 2.2.1a-4 as it is causing
    smbd to die with signal 11 under some unidentified situations.
    Closes: #109774: Latest debian version breaks printer driver download.
    Closes: #109946: not all files appear in samba-exported directories.
  * Another patch from Steve Langasek. This one adds quotes around 
    printer names for print systems it's reasonable for Debian to
    support. Together with the patch in #29957 (see changelog for
    2.2.1a-4), this should take care of the problems with multi-word 
    printer names in Samba.

samba (2.2.1a-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Important changes that affect how Samba is built on Debian
    machines are implemented in this release. All of this changes
    were suggested by the energetic Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>,
    and his arguments were so sound and reasonable that I decided
    to implement them. Here's Steve's original changelog:

       * Fix up the build system to avoid needing to run configure 
         as root to answer questions we already know the answers to.
       * In the process, make surprising progress towards being able to
         cross-compile the samba packages.

    a bug-free Samba" Langasek.
    Closes: #47493: Samba doesn't handle ':' in dir names right.

samba (2.2.1a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steve Langasek <vorlon@netexpress.net> has been hard at work in
    the last few days looking at the long list of open bugs filed
    against the Samba packages. I don't know how to thank him. It's been
    a pleasure working with Steve, and all the fixes, patches, etc. in
    this release come from him. The bug list is greatly reduced thanks
    to Steve's efforts.
  * Steve's additions/modifications/patches/etc. are:
    - New package that (libpam-smbpass) provides pam_smbpass. Before, this
      was provided in another package but now the sources are part of
      the Samba sources so we can start providing it from here.
      Closes: #107043 - pam_smbpass now present in Samba source,
        should be built from there
    - Patch to source/smbd/service.c that allows admins to call
      /bin/umount from the root postexec of a Samba share.
      Closes: #40561 - samba pre/postexec commands do not work.
    - Clear TMPDIR before starting smbd in /etc/init.d/samba.
      Closes: #51295 - Problems with Samba and TMPDIR.
    - Correction to documentation of "guest only".
      Closes #38282 - "guest only" share still requires a password.
  * Applied patch from Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es> to convert
    /usr/sbin/mksmbpasswd from a shell script into a real awk script.
    Sorry it took so long, Santiago; I hadn't realized you even
    provided a patch :-)
    Closes: #77891 - mksmbpasswd could be a real awk script.
  * Updated description of the smbfs and smbclient packages. Also have
    each package recommend the other.
    Closes: #108650: Should suggest or recommend smbfs.

  * Build-depends: depend on debhelper (>=2.0.103).
    Closes: #105795: Build-Depends are wrong.
  * Run samba's preinst and postinst scripts without -e so failed commands
    do not abort installation.

                    incompatibility with PAM.
    Closes: #97447: nmbd crashes due to bugs in DAVE 2.5.2.
    Closes: #95777: Samba 2.2 is unable to join or authenticate against 
                    Samba 2.2 PDC domain.
    Closes: #68842: samba should use PAM for password changing (I
                    haven't personally tried this one, but it's been
                    advertised this works.)
    Closes: #102506: PAM account checking fails.
    Closes: #102518: Complains about unknown paramter "obey pam
                     restrictions"

    Closes: #98365: addtosmbpass is missing from 2.2.0.final-2.
  * Updated sample /etc/samba/smb.conf to reflect the recent changes

samba (2.2.0.final-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added libcupsys2-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Samba depends now (again) on netbase so update-inetd is always
    available for the Samba maintainer scripts.
    Closes: #86063: Fails to uninstall if inetd is not installed.
  * Updated source/config.{sub,guess} so ARM built doesn't fail.

  * Goofy version number because of my stupidity when assigning version
    numbers to the CVS packages I have been uploading to experimental.
    Will be fixed when 2.2.1 is released. I've no doubts a 2.2.1 release
    will follow soon.

samba (2.2.0.cvs20010316-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Started working on Samba 2.2.0. Using the SAMBA_2_2_0 branch
    from Samba CVS.
  * Not compiling rpctorture as it has compile errors. Change in
    debian/rules.
  * Removed Linux kernel 2.0.x and smbfs compatibility baggage. Now
    the smbfs does not support 2.0.x kernels; a kernel > 2.2.x is
    needed to use smbfs. Updated debian/control, debian/rules and
    README.Debian to reflect this change.
  * Added to swat a versioned dependency on samba (so a user is forced to
    install a new version of swat each time a new version of samba is
    installed.)

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Mar 2001 14:21:14 -0500

samba (2.0.7-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Applied Urban Widmark <urban@teststation.com> fixes to smbmount. Urban

    utilities.
  * Links to HTML documents are correct now.
    Closes: #69439: swat: Broken help file symlinks
    Closes: #72615: samba-doc directory changed: removed htmldocs from path
    Closes: #75847: swat: Wrong symlink
    Closes: #66857: Wrong links to html documents.
    Closes: #77912: misplaced documentation symlinks for swat
  * Building Samba with CUPS support. For this I reverted the change to
    source/configure.in that I did in 2.0.7-3 and re-ran autoconf.
    Closes: #59038: samba: not compiled with cups support.
  * Fix against previous known/unknown user time difference patch to swat
    (make username / password lookups take the same time.) Remove CGI
    logging code in Swat.
    Closes: #76341 - Security holes in swat
  * Updated Build-depends.
  * Updated debian/copyright to refer to the correct location of the GPL.
  * debian/rules: changed DESTDIR to `pwd`/debian/samba (was
    `pwd`/debian/tmp.)
  * debian/rules: added '--sourcedir=debian/samba' to dh_movefiles (for some
    strange reason dh_installdirs is not creating debian/tmp/ so I needed
    to tweak everything to install stuff in debian/samba rather than in
    debian/tmp.)
  * debian/control: changed section of samba-docs to 'doc' (was 'docs')
  * Using relative symlinks in /usr/share/samba/swat/ (changed debian/rules
    and source/scripts/installswat.sh.)
  * Fixed (by tweaking debian/rules)
    /usr/bin/{smbmnt,smbumount-2.*,smbmount-2.*} to be suid.
  * Added "Provides: samba-client" to smbclient's section in control.
    Closes: #71143: smbclient: Smbclient should provide samba-client.
  * Fix for desired_access being zero in map_share_mode() (patch to
    source/smbd/nttrans.c.) Thanks to Gary Wilson
    <wilsong@sergievsky.cpmc.columbia.edu> for bringing this patch to my
    attention.
  * Hacked source/lib/util_sec.c so smbd works fine in both 2.0.x and
    2.2.x kernels even when the build is done in a system running
    a 2.2.x kernel.

samba (2.0.7-3) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Release manager: this closes a RC bug.
  * Commented out the section in source/configure.in that auto-detects
    CUPS support and then ran autoconf to generate a new configure
    script. This was done to prevent machines that have libcupsys-dev
    installed from detecting CUPS support and adding an unwanted
    dependency on libcupsys. This way the whole printing system
    won't break on upgrades. CUPS support should be added after
    Potato is released.
    Closes: #65185: samba-common: Upgrading removes printing system.
    Closes: #64496: smbfs: smbfs on powerpc has a dependency on cupsys.
  * Updated README.debian.

samba (2.0.7-2) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Release manager: this closes RC bug #63839 that prevents Samba
    to be built from source.
  * Fixed a stupid typo in debian/rules that was preventing Samba
    to be built from source.
    Closes: #63839: samba_2.0.7-1(frozen): build error (SAMBABOOK dir)
  * I forgot to mention that O'Reilly's book "Using Samba" was donated
    to the Open Source community. The book was included in Samba 2.0.7
    in HTML format and is part of the Debian Samba package since 
    Samba 2.0.7-1.
  * In Samba 2.0.7-1, the "Using Samba" book and a number of HTML help
    files were supposed to be provided in both the swat and the samba-doc
    packages. This duplication was a waste of space. Starting with
    Samba 2.0.7-2, swat recommends samba-doc and the book and the HTML
    files are included only in samba-doc, and are accessed via symlinks
    from within swat.
    Closes: #58810: superfluous files in swat?
  * Added a 'echo "."' to /etc/init.d/samba in the reload) section.
    Closes: #63394: "echo ." missing in reload section of init.d script
  * Fixed typo in docs/htmldocs/using_samba/ch06_05.html.
    Closes: #64344: typo "encrypted passwords"
  * Cleaned up samba's postrm script so important common files aren't
    deleted when samba is purged. Created a samba-common.postrm script.
    Closes: #62675: purging samba removes /etc/samba/smb.conf.
    Closes: #63386: samba --purge removes /etc/samba dir even though
            smbclient/smbfs/samba-common packages are still installed

samba (2.0.7-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Dear Release Manager: please allow this 
    package to go to frozen as it contains fixes to a _lot_ of problems.
    You can take a look at all the problems fixed by this release in
    the official upstream announcement at
    http://us1.samba.org/samba/whatsnew/samba-2.0.7.html.
  * Added --with-utmp to add utmp support to smbd (this is new in Samba
    2.0.7)
  * Closes: #62148 - samba not rotating filled logs.
  * Closes: #56711: Samba doesn't manage well long share name (please note
      that it's possible to connect to shares with names longer than
      14 characters but the share will be listed with a name truncated to
      13 characters.)
  * Closes: #51752 - NT DOMAIN - NET USE * /HOME not mapping (error 67).
    Closes: #50907 - logon path not working.
    This is not a bug, it's just Samba doing the same thing an NT server
    does. See WHATSNEW.txt and smb.conf's man page for details.
  * Closes: #48497 - error executing smbsh in debian-potato. (smbwrapper
    is not supported anymore.)
  * Closes: #58994 swat: typo in swat description.
  * Closes: #45931 - Samba dies with SIGILL on startup. (Hardware 
    problems, person that reported the bug never came back.)
    Closes: #54398 - smbadduser fails, looks for ypcat.
  * Fixed swat's man page to include Debian specific installation
    instructions. There's not necessary to edit /etc/services or 
    /etc/inetd.conf.
    (Closes: #58616 - incomplete install config && incorrect installation
      instructions.)
  * s/SBINDIR/\"/usr/sbin\"/g in source/web/startstop.c to prevent swat
    to look for smbd and nmbd in the wrong place when requested to start or
    stop smbd or nmbd.
    (Closes: #55028 - swat can't start samba servers.)
  * Closes: #37274: smbclient does not honour pot. (Tested and seems to be
    working now.)
  * Not confirmed, but should fix #56699, #62185, #56247, #52218, #43492,
    #50479, #39818, #54383, #59411.
    (please re-open any of this if the problem still exists - I was unable
    to confirm any of this because I could never reproduce them.)
    Closes: #56699 - Samba's nmbd causes random kernel oops several
      times in a row.
    Closes: #62185 - nmbd's forking until no more file descriptors are 
      available.
    Closes: #56247 - session setup failed: ERRSRV - ERRbadpw.

samba (2.0.6-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Oppsss! samba-common doesn't depend on libcupsys1 so the binaries
    in this package are broken unless libcupsys1 is installed.
    samba-common has a "grave" bug because of this. Instead of adding 
    libcupsys1 to the Depends: list of each package in debian/control
    I investigated why dh_shlibs was not picking the dependency
    automatically. It turns out that it's probably a bug in libcupsys1
    because the format of its shlibs file is not correct. I fixed that
    file (/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcupsys1.shlibs) and now dependencies are
    picked correctly. I'll talk to the libcupsys1 maintainer.

    I think the addition of CUPS support to Samba is a big change that
    should not go into Frozen. So, I decided to back up the addition
    of CUPS support I did in 2.0.6-4 to minimize problems. I'll add
    CUPS support again when I start working on Samba for Woody.
    (Closes: #59337 - samba-common has a missing dependency)

samba (2.0.6-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * It seems that sometimes nmbd or smbd are not killed when upgrading.
    I think it is because in samba's prerm script I was calling
    start-stop-daemon with the --pidfile switch and in old versions of
    Samba the nmbd and smbd daemons did not store their PIDs in a file in
    /var/samba/. I changed debian/samba.prerm so the existence of the
    PID files is checked before calling "start-stop-daemon --pidfile ..."
    If the PID files do not exist then start-stop-daemon is called
    without the --pidfile parameter.
    (Closes: #58058 - upgrade from slink went badly)
  * Fixed typo in description of swat package in debian/control.
  * Installed libcupsys1-dev so the configure script picks up CUPS
    and Samba is compiled with CUPS support. Also added libcupsys1 to
    the Depends: list of package samba in debian/control.
    (Closes: #59038 - samba not compiled with cups support)
  * Added a small paragraph to debian/README.debian warning about possible
    problems with the WINS code in Samba 2.0.6.

samba (2.0.6-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch posted by Jeremy Allison to the samba mailing list
    that should take care of the internal errors reported in bug #52698
    (release-critical). Wichert: please test as I never could reproduce
    it here.
    (Closes: #52698 - samba gets interbal errors)
  * Moved samba-docs to the 'docs' section.
    (Closes: #51077 - samba-doc: wrong section)
  * Added reload capability to /etc/init.d/samba (only for smbd because
    nmbd does not support reloading after receiving a signal).
    (Closes: #50954 - patch to add reload support to /etc/init.d/samba)
  * Corrected "passwd chat" parameter in sample /etc/samba/smb.conf so
    Unix password syncronization works with the passwd program currently
    in Potato. Thanks to Augustin Luton <aluton@hybrigenics.fr> for
    the correct chat script.
  * Stole source/lib/util_sec.c from the CVS tree of what will become
    Samba 2.0.7 or whatever so we can use the same binaries under
    both 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernels.
    (Closes: #51331 - PANIC: failed to set gid)
  * smbadduser is now provided as an example and it's customized for Debian.
    I am not providing this script in /usr/sbin/ because then I would need
    a dependency on csh, something that I don't want to do.
    (Closes: #51697, #54052)
  * Fixed the short description of the smbfs package in debian/control.
    (Closes: 53534 - one-line description out of date).

samba (2.0.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * samba-common now depends on libpam-modules (not on libpam-pwdb, which
    I have been told is obsolete). I modified /etc/pam.d/samba accordingly
    to reflect the change.
    (Closes: Bug#50722: pam pwdb dependence?).
  * The old /etc/pam.d/samba file which had references to pam_pwdb caused
    smbd to die with a signal 11. The new /etc/pam.d/samba file fixes
    this problem.
    (Closes: #50876, #50838, #50698)
  * Compiled with syslog support (use at your own risk: syslog support
    is still experimental in Samba). I added the parameters "syslog = 0"
    and "syslog only = no" to the sample smb.conf to avoid pestering
    users that do not want Samba to log through syslog.
    (Closes: Bug#50703 - syslog only option doesn't work)
  * Removed the stupid code in the smbmount wrapper script that tries
    to load the smbfs module if smbfs is not listed in /proc/filesystems.
    (Closes: Bug#50759 - Non-root can't run smbmount if SMBFS is compiled
    as a module in the kernel)
  * Added /bin/mount.smb as a symlink pointing to /usr/bin/smbmount so
    'mount -t smb ...' works just as 'mount -t smbfs ...'.

samba (2.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Samba 2.0.6 has been released. This is the first try of the Debian
    Samba packages. I know for sure that smbd won't work properly on
    2.0.x kernels because the patch that Wichert sent me does not apply
    to the new source/lib/util_sec.c in Samba 2.0.6. That file was
    completely re-written by Tridge.
  * Updated README.Debian.
  * A new client utility called smbspool appeared in Samba 2.0.6. I added
    this utility to the smbclient package, although I haven't tried it yet.
  * Added the symlink /sbin/mount.smbfs that points to /usr/bin/smbmount.
    This is to be able to type "mouont -t smbfs ...". This symlink goes
    in the smbfs package, of course.
  * This new release should close the following bugs (some of these
    are fixed for sure in this new upstream release, some others I could
    not reproduce but I believe they are fixed if they were real bugs.
    As always, please feel free to re-open the bugs if the problem is not
    solved).

  * Samba has been compiled with PAM support (closes: Bug#39512 - samba PAM
    module). To succesfully add PAM support, I created /etc/pam.d/samba and
    added this file as a conffile for the samba-common package. I also made
    samba-common depend on libpam-pwdb.
  * Added simple man pages for the wrapper scripts smbmount and smbmount.
    (Closes: Bug#44705 - Missing smbmount man page)
  * Installed libreadlineg2-dev in my system so smbclient now has a
    "history" command and libreadline support :-)
  * This time I did add a check to the smbmount wrapper script to see if
    the kernel has support for smbfs, as suggested by Jeroen Schaap
    <J.Schaap@physiology.medfac.leidenuniv.nl>. I mentioned in the changelog
    for samba-2.0.5a-3 that I did this but I forgot at the end.

samba (2.0.5a-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * I am sorry to report that the smbwrapper package is gone for the
    moment. The reason for this is twofold: first of all, smbwrapper
    is completely broken in Samba-2.0.5a (it compiles but it doesn't
    run) and in the upcoming Samba-2.0.6 it doesn't even compile. Second,
    when I asked Andrew Tridgell (father of Samba) about the state of
    smbwrapper he told me that Ulrich Drepper (head of the glibc project)
    broke on purpose the glibc stuff in which smbwrapper is based.
    Consequently, Tridge recommended me to compile Samba without
    support for smbwrapper. When, I have no idea. Sorry folks. Here is
    the original message I received from Andrew:
    
    > 1) 2.0.5a's smbwrapper doesn't work under glibc2.1, and pre-2.0.6's
    > smbwrapper doesn't even compile under glibc2.1.
    
    yep, Ulrich deliberately broke it. It won't get fixed till glibc
    allows the sorts of games it plays to work again. I suggest you turn
    it off in your build scripts until that gets sorted out.
    
  * Swat's file are now in /usr/share/samba/ instead of
    /usr/lib/samba/ (bug #49011).
  * Man pages now in /usr/share/man/ instead of /usr/man/ (bug #49011).

samba (2.0.5a-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from our fearless leader (Wichert) to fix the darn bug
    that prevents Samba to work on 2.0.x kernels if it was compiled
    in a system running a 2.2.x kernel. This closes #40645 (build uses
    setresuid which doesn't work under 2.0.34 (does apparently under
    2.2.x) ).
  * Fixed the entry that swat's postinst script adds to /etc/inetd.conf
    so it is '#<off># swat\t\tstream\ttcp\tnowait.400 ...' instead of
    '#<off>#swat\t\tstream\ttcp\tnowait.400 ...'. The old way caused
    'update-inetd --enable swat' to leave the entry for swat disabled.
    Thanks to Dave Burchell <burchell@inetnebr.com> for finding out
    this problem. This closes #48762 (swat uses non-standard syntax to 
    comment out inetd.conf entry).
  * /usr/sbin/swat does not think anymore that the smbd daemon lives
    in /usr/local/samba/bin/. To fix this I am running now source/configure
    with "--prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/usr". This closes #47716 (samba
    'swat' fails: incorrect hardwired path in the binary).

samba (2.0.5a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * I am pretty darn busy with my MBA, I apologize for the long time it's
    taking to squash bugs in the Samba packages.
  * Built with debhelper v2 for FHS compliancy. Changed a couple of
    things in debian/rules to accomodate for the new place for the docs.
    I also had to change debian/{samba.postinst,samba.prerm,swat.postinst}
    to make sure that the symlink from /usr/doc/xxx exists and points to
    /usr/share/doc/xxx (the reason for this is that I am not letting
    debhelper to create these scripts for me automatically).
  * Built with latest libc6.
  * smbfs: finally, the nasty bug that causes smbmount to die after
    a while is gone thanks to Ben Tilly <Ben_Tilly@trepp.com>.
    The problem was just a typo in source/client/smbmount.c.
    This closes grave bug #42764 (smbmount dies) and #43341 
    (smbfs-2.2.x won't function after a while).
  * Fixed the smbmount wrapper script to eliminate a bashism (closes
    #45202 - "wrapper scripts use $* instead of "$@") and to recognize 
    2.3.x and 2.4.x kernels (closes #47688 - "smbfs: does not recognize 
    kernel 2.3.x").
  * Added a check to the smbmount wrapper script to see if the
    kernel has support for smbfs, as suggested by Jeroen Schaap
    <J.Schaap@physiology.medfac.leidenuniv.nl>.
  * swat's man page is now part of the swat package, not of the samba
    package. This closes #44808 (Samba has a man page for swat, but 
    the binary is not included).
  * The interface program smbrun is not longer needed by smbd because
    of the availability of execl() under Linux. Because of this, the
    smbrun is not even being compiled. Since there is no need for smbrun
    now, the smbrun man page was taken out of the samba package. This
    closes #45266 (/usr/bin/smbrun missing).
  * smbpasswd is now part of the samba-common package, and not part of
    the samba package. This is to let administrators that do not want
    to install a full Samba server administer passwords in remote
    machines. This closes bug #42624 (smbpasswd should be included in 
    smbclient). This bug report also suggests that swat becomes part of 
    the samba package, that smbfs becomes part of the smbclient package,
    and that the binary smbpasswd becomes part of the smbclient package.
    I moved smbpasswd to the samba-common package but I am reluctant to 
    do the other things the bug report suggests.
  * In order to keep dpkg happy when moving smbpasswd from the samba
    package to samba-common, I had to add a "Replaces: samba (<= 2.0.5a-2)"
    in the control section of the samba-common package and a
    "Replaces: samba-common (<= 2.0.5a-2)" in the control section of the
    samba package (in debian.control).
  * Samba is now being compiled with the "--with-netatalk" option. This
    closes #47480 (Could samba be compiled with the --with-netatalk option).
  * All packages that depend on samba-common have a versioned dependency
    now. This was accomplished by adding "(= ${Source-Version})" to the
    relevant sections of debian/control. Thanks t Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho
    <gaia@iki.fi> for the hint. This closes #42985 (samba should probably
    have a versioned depends on samba-common).
  * Made sure the file docs/textdocs/DIAGNOSIS.txt gets installed in all
    the Samba packages. This closes bug #42049 (no DIAGNOSTICS.txt file).
  * Added the smbadduser helper script to the samba package. This closes
    #44480 (Samba doesn't come with the smbadduser program).
  * Applied patch from szasz@triton.sch.bme.hu that prevents smbmount
    to leave an entry in /etc/mtab for a share that could not be mounted
    because of invalid user of password. The patch also allows smbumount
    to unmount the share in the event that something goes wrong with the
    smbmount process. This closes bug #48613 (Mount/umount problems + 
    patch) as well as #44130 (failed mount is still mounted).
  * smbmount-2.2.x is now setuid root. This is needed for the patch
    applied above to be effective. If smbmount-2.2.x is not setuid root
    then an entry will be left in /etc/mtab even when the mount
    fails. I had to add "usr/bin/smbmount-2.2.x" to debian/smbfs.suid
    for this to work.

samba (2.0.5a-1) stable; urgency=high

  * I'm back from the Honey Moon. We are pretty busy because we are moving
    to Pittsburgh (from Caracas, Venezuela) in aprox. 24 hours and we still
    have plenty of things to pack and to do. Samba 2.0.5 was released
    while I was in the Honey Moon and it is just now (almost 3 AM) when
    I have time to package it.
  * Because of the security problems fixed in 2.0.5, this upload goes
    to both stable and unstable (the Security Team asked for this).
  * This release (2.0.5a-1) was compiled on a Slink system. 2.0.5a-2 will
    be compiled on a Potato system.
  * Added a "Replaces: samba (<= 1.9.18p10-7)" to the samba-common
    section in debian/control (as suggested by Steve Haslam
    <araqnid@debian.org>) to fix the problems that appear when upgrading 
    from the Samba package in Slink. Please test this as I am completely 
    unable to do so. This should fix bug #39818 (Upgrading Samba from the 
    Slink version).
  * Removed the hacks to the autoconf stuff that I added to 2.0.4b-2 in 
    order to have defined several socket options when compiling with
    Linux 2.2.x kernel headers - the fix is now upstream.
  * Finally!!! smbmount was re-written (thanks Tridge :-) to use a command
    line syntax similar to the one used by the old smbmount (for 2.0.x 
    kernels). This means that the wrapper script is no longer necessary
    so I removed it. In its place there is a simple wrapper script that
    calls smbmount-2.0.x or smbmount-2.2.x depending on the kernel that is
    running.
  * Because of the wedding, the Honey Moon, and our move to Pittsburgh,
    I can't work on fixing other bugs in this release.

samba (2.0.4b-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stupid mistake: I forgot to add /usr/bin/smbumount to debian/smbfs.files
    and because of this /usr/bin/smbumount was part of the samba package
    instead of part of the smbfs package.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jul 1999 01:51:24 -0400

samba (2.0.4b-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dark (and archive maintainers): please remove from Potato the smbfsx 
    binary package and also the old source package for smbfs. smbfs and 
    smbfsx have been merged starting with this version.
  * Merged the old smbfs package with Samba. Now there is only one package
    for the smbfs utilities and is called "smbfs". The package smbfsx
    does not exist any more and this new smbfs package must be used
    for both 2.0.x and > 2.1.x kernels.
  * A wrapper script was added to handle the syntax change in smbmount
    in the new smbfs utilities (required for kernels > 2.1.70). The
    home page for this script is http://www.wittsend.com/mhw/smbmount.html.
    Please _note_ that this will change (for good) in Samba 2.0.5 :-)
  * Added debian/smbumount.sh. It's another wrapper that calls smbumount-2.2.x
    or smbumount-2.0.x depending on the kernel currently running.
  * Not using -t for savelog in cron.weekly script.
  * Recompiled without libreadlineg-dev (Samba does not seem to be using
    it so unnecessary dependencies are produced).
  * glibc2.1 build.
  * Removed smbpasswd.8 man page from the debian/ directory because it is
    now being provided upstream.
  * Got rid of the ugly hack I put in source/lib/util_sock.c to have
    IPTOS_LOWDELAY and IPTOS_THROUGHPUT defined. Now I patched the
    autoconf stuff to #include <netinet/ip.h>. I've sent the patch to
    Jeremy Allison so we have this upstream.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Jun 1999 17:47:19 -0400

samba (2.0.4b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This release fixes the following Debian bugs:
    #33838 (Amanda/ Samba 2.0.2 and backing up large filesystems) and
    #33867 (Amanda 2.4.1 and Samba 2.0.2 and large filesystems). Jeremy
    Allison released Samba 2.0.4 and found out that there were a couple
    of minor bugs so he released 2.0.4a. Then he found out about more
    serious bugs and released 2.0.4b. I have built this package several
    times between yesterday and today because of this. Now I am releasing
    the Debian packages for Samba with what I believe will be the latest
    release the Samba Team will make at least in the next 4 days (Jeremy
    is taking a short vacation).
  * Still compiling against glibc2.0 (sorry about that :-)
  * Hacked source/smbwrapper/smbsh.c to fix the problem
    of smbsh not finding the shared library smbwrapper.so. It looks
    now in /usr/lib/samba/ for this file. This fixes #32971, #32989,
    #33278, #34911 and #36317.
  * Made smbfsx depend on samba-common because smbfsx uses /etc/samba/smb.conf
    and /etc/samba/codepages/. This fixes #33128 (smbmount complains about
    missing /etc/smb.conf).
  * Package swat does not depend on httpd anymore (there's no need to).
    This fixes #35795 (swat requires httpd).
  * Renamed smbmount-2.1.x and smbumount-2.1.x to smbmount-2.2.x and
    smbumount-2.2.x. Same applies to the man pages.
  * Changed minor type in smbmount's man page (changed "\"" by "\'"). This
    fixes #34070 (wrong quotes in manpage).
  * Used Fabrizio Polacco's <fpolacco@icenet.fi> procedure to create the
    Debian package for Samba. This closes #35781 (samba has no pristine 
    source).
  * Changes to /etc/cron.weely/samba: rotate /var/log/{nmb,smb}.old only
    if the size of either is different than 0. Also, added comments at the
    beginning of this script to explain how rotation of log files works in
    Samba. Thanks to ujr@physik.phy.tu-dresden.de (Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler)
    for the suggestions. This closes #37490 (cron.weekly script rotates not
    used [sn]mb.old files). As I side effect, this should also close
    #31462 (still trouble with /etc/cron.weekly/samba).
  * Check for old /etc/pam.d/samba file which is not provided by this version
    of the Debian Samba package but was provided in older versions. If this
    file exists we delete it. We check for this in the postinst. This closes
    #37356 (samba put stuff in pam.d that pam complains about) and #34312 
    (libpam0g: questions during upgrade).
  * Make sure the mode of /etc/samba/smbpasswd is set to 600. This is done
    in the postinst script. This closes #35730 (Security problem with 
    /etc/samba/smbpasswd when upgrading from samba 1.9.18p8-2 to 2.0.3-1).
  * I have just checked and it looks like #28748 (smbfsx doesn't "return ")
    has been fixed. This might have been fixed since a long time ago.
  * Long long standing bug #18488 (smbclient: internal tar is broken) is
    closed in this release of Samba. The bug might have been closed for a 
    long long time, but I did not check for this before.
  * Temporary fix to the annoying "Unknown socket option IPTOS_LOWDELAY"
    message. This fixes #33698 (socket option IPTOS_LOWDELAY no longer works),
    #34148 (warnings from smbd) and #35333 (samba warnings).

samba (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Removed the convert_smbpasswd.pl program I created and put in
    /usr/doc/samba/ because there's a convert_smbpasswd script in the
    upstream sources that does the same thing. I modified the postinst
    script to use this script instead of the one I created.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Feb 1999 01:35:37 -0400

samba (2.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the README.Debian file.
  * Updated the description of the samba package in the control file.
  * The binaries smbmnt and smbumount-2.1.x in the smbfsx package are now
    installed setuid root as they should be. This was done by doing a
    a "chmod u+s" for each binary in debian/rules and by creating the 
    file debian/smbfsx.suid.
  * Minor patch to source/client/smbumount.c to allow normal users
    to umount what they have mounted (problem was a kernel vs. libc6
    size mismatch). I sent the patch upstream.
  * Created debian/smbwrapper.dirs so the directory /usr/lib/samba/ is
    created.
  * Modified debian/rules to move smbwrapper.so from debian/tmp/usr/bin/ to
    debian/smbwrapper/usr/lib/samba/.
  * Hacked source/smbwrapper/smbsh.c to fix the problem
    of smbsh not finding the shared library smbwrapper.so.

samba (2.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Feb 1999 01:35:51 -0400

samba (2.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Feb 1999 06:51:18 -0400

samba (2.0.0final-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The samba postinst made an unwarranted assumption that the file
    /etc/samba/smbpasswd exists. If the file did not exist (which is
    perfectly valid) the postinst will fail. This fixes #32953.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Feb 1999 23:32:46 -0400

samba (2.0.0final-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added to debian/control a "Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}" line for the
    samba-common package so dependencies for this package are set
    correctly (thanks to Dark for pointing this out).

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Feb 1999 09:45:21 -0400

samba (2.0.0final-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally!!! The first upload to unstable. Sorry for the delay folks
    but I have been quite busy lately :-) Another reason for the delay
    is that I wanted to ease the migration from Samba 1.9.18p10 and
    before to Samba 2.0.0. I changed the location of the config. files 
    from /etc/ to /etc/samba/ and this made things a little bit harder.
  * This package needs 2.2 kernel headers to compile (well, this is
    true for the smbfsx package, all others compile fine with 2.0 kernel
    headers).
  * Created a preinst script for the samba package to take care of the
    location migration of smb.conf (from /etc/ to /etc/samba/). The
    preinst script also takes care of moving /etc/smbpasswd to its new
    location (/etc/samba/).
  * Created postinst and postrm scripts to add/remove an entry for swat
    in /etc/inetd.conf.
  * I had forgotten to install the sambaconfig script so I changed
    debian/rules to install this script.
  * Added a postrm script for the samba package (I had forgotten to add 
    this script to the new Samba packages after the migration from 1.9.18 
    to 2.0.0).
  * Created a small Perl script that is called from the samba postinst
    to convert the smbpasswd from the old format used in version prior
    to 2.0.0 to the new one used in 2.0.0 and beyond.
  * The upgrade process should be automatically now. Please let me know
    of any problems you encounter.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Sat, 23 Jan 1999 09:34:10 -0400

samba (2.0.0final-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Finally!!! Samba 2.0.0 is here! I am not uploading to unstable
    because I still have to work out the migration from the old
    samba packages to the new ones. I also need to work more on the
    new swat package.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Jan 1999 22:40:02 -0400

samba (2.0.0beta5-1) experimental; urgency=low

samba (2.0.0beta3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * I have just realized that the documentation patches (for man pages)
    that I used for the 1.9.18 release are not longer necessary because
    there was a major re-write of all the Samba documentation that added
    the missing bits of information. So, I have just removed these minor
    patches.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Dec 1998 12:00:30 -0400

samba (2.0.0beta2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * This new version fixes the potential security problem that
    was posted to debian-private (using the "message command" parameter
    to execute arbitrary commands from messages sent from LinPopUp).
  * Changed /etc/init.d/samba to use one of the variables stored in
    /etc/samba/debian_config to know how Samba is being run (from inetd or
    as daemons) instead of grepping /etc/inetd.conf which may not exist
    if the user is running xinetd (this fixes bug #29687 - assumes using 
    vanilla inetd)

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Nov 1998 23:32:03 -0400

samba (2.0.0beta1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First beta release of the samba-2.0.0 code. Before the beta I was
    working with sources downloaded directly from the CVS server. This
    package goes into experimental and I plan to release the new
    samba to unstable as soon as it gets out of beta.
  * Created several packages out of the Samba sources. They are:
    samba (nmbd and smbd daemons + related programs), smbclient (FTP
    like command line utility to retrieve files from SMB servers),
    swat (Samba Web Administration Tool), samba-common (common files
    used by samba, smbclient and swat), smbfsx (smbfs utilities for
    kernels >= 2.1.70), smbwrapper and samba-doc (Samba documentation).
  * Refreshed debian/samba-doc.docs so recently added docs. are
    installed in the samba-doc package. New additions include man
    pages in the /usr/doc/samba-doc/htmldocs/ directory.
  * Deleted Debian specific nmblookup(1) man page as it is now upstream.
  * Added smbtorture to smbclient package.
  * Moved rpcclient from the samba package to the smbclient package.
  * The Samba daemons (nmbd and smbd) now create a PID file so I changed
    all calls to start-stop-daemon to use the PID file.
  * Fixed debian/rules to install mksmbpasswd (fixes #27655).
  * Modified /etc/init.d/samba so nmbd is started without the -a (append
    to the log file instead of overwrite) switch. The new behavior of
    nmbd is to NOT overwrite log files, so the -a switch can be deleted
    safely.
  * Moved from debstd to debhelper.

samba (1.9.18p10-5) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Oppsss!!! While fixing bug #26884 I introduced a bug even worse than
    the one I was trying to fix: in /etc/init.d/samba I got rid of the test
    that tells us whether the Samba daemons are running from inetd or as
    standalone daemons. I corrected the problem by editing again
    /etc/init.d/samba to uncomment the test.
  * Wishlist bug #28298 (typos in samba) was fixed.
  * Wishlist bug #28309 (typos in smb.conf) was fixed.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Oct 1998 09:11:47 -0400

samba (1.9.18p10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor patch to debian/rules to delete *substvars instead of only
    substvars when doing a "debian/rules clean" (thanks to Daniel Jacobowitz
    <dmj@andrew.cmu.edu> for this).
  * Small patch to source/shmem_sysv.c that eases compilation under
    glibc-2.1 (thanks to Daniel <dmj@andrew.cmu.edu> for this).

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Sep 1998 15:33:49 -0400

samba (1.9.18p10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patched smbclient again to fix minor formatting problem introduced
    by Magosanyi Arpad's smbclient patch.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Sep 1998 11:03:23 -0400

samba (1.9.18p10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sync'ed include files for the smbfs utilities with the ones in
    kernel 2.1.119.
  * Added to the /usr/doc/samba/examples/ directory a new script called 
    wins2dns (courtesy of Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@deltatee.com>) that 
    generates BIND sonze files for hosts in the WINS database.
  * Patched smbclient to include enhancements by Magosanyi Arpad 
    <mag@bunuel.tii.matav.hu> that make scripting easier.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Aug 1998 13:34:54 -0400

samba (1.9.18p10-1) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (see /usr/doc/samba/WHATSNEW.txt for a
    description of what has changed). I built a 1.9.18p9-1 but I
    never released it because an obscure bug was found just a couple
    of days before the official release, so the Samba Team stopped
    the rollover of 1.9.18p9.
  * Updated documentation (new files were added to the docs/ directory
    that were not installed in /usr/doc/samba/).
  * Fixed long standing bug #7695 (smb.conf's man page doesn't document
    'printing=lprng') - I made a couple of changes to the man page to 
    include references to lprng.
  * Fixes bug #24930 (samba needs to suggest psmisc?). I don't think it
    is necessary to make samba suggest psmisc just because the postinst
    script mentions to call killall. So, I removed all references to
    "killall" in the scripts.
  * Fixes bug #25999 (Samba does not by default work with unix password
    sync): I added the "passwd program" and "passwd chat" parameters to
    the sample smb.conf to reflect the Debian environment.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Aug 1998 08:59:18 -0400

samba (1.9.18p9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (see /usr/doc/samba/WHATSNEW.txt for a
    description of what has changed).
  * Removed Jeremy Allison's patch applied to 1.9.18p8-2 because it is
    now part of the new upstream version.
  * Corrected small typo in addtosmbpass' man page (fixes #25629).

samba (1.9.18p8-2) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Applied patch received from Jeremy Allison (Samba Team) that fixes
    "grave" bug #23903 (samba maps username before authenicating with 
    NT password server).
  * Added a "sleep 2" between "start-stop-daemon --stop" and
    "start-stop-daemon --start" in /etc/init.d/samba so when this script
    is called with the "restart" parameter the Samba daemons are restarted
    properly. This fixes bug #24211 (init.d script doesn't restart).
  * Sent start-stop-daemon output in /etc/init.d/samba to /dev/null to
    avoid annoying warning messages.
  * Added perfomance tune parameters to sample /etc/smb.conf (SO_SNDBUF=4096
    and SO_RCVBUF=4096 to "socket options" in /etc/smb.conf). I can't
    find who sent this suggestion to me. If you are listening, drop me a
    note and I'll put your name here :-)

  * New upstream release that fixes _lots_ of "ugly" bugs. The list of
    fixed bugs is too long to include here (see /usr/doc/samba/WHATSNEW.txt).
  * Fixed postinst to quote arguments to if [ arg .. ] constructs
    (fixes #22881).
  * Applied Jeremy Allison's patch (posted to the samba-ntdom mailing
    list) that solves a problem with username maps (the Samba Team did
    not catch this problem before final 1.9.18p8).
  * Made /etc/init.d/samba to print out a warning when Samba is running
    from inetd and the user runs /etc/init.d/samba to start|stop|restart
    Samba (there's no point on doing this because inetd will start the
    daemons again when there is traffic on UDP port 137-139).

  * Fixes the serious problem of having the WINS name server
    database getting deleted at boot time. That happened because the
    WINS database was being stored under /var/lock/samba/ and all files
    under /var/lock/ are deleted at boot time. The place where the WINS
    database is stored was moved to /var/samba/.

  * New upstream release that fixes a possible buffer overflow.
    This security hole was reported on BugTraq by Drago. The

samba (1.9.18p4-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version that fixes several bugs.
  * New scheme for keeping track of Debian specific configuration.
    This new scheme fixes bug #18624 (Samba always asks the user about

    configuration information in /etc/samba/debian_config.
  * Changes to /usr/sbin/sambaconfig, prerm and postinst to support the 
    new configuration scheme.
  * Moved required kernel 2.1.x include files inside the source tree
    so I don't have to do very nasty things like creating crazy
    symlinks in /usr/include to make this package compile. This
    allows non-root users to build the package and fixes bug
    #20104.
  * Fixed address of the FSF in /usr/doc/samba/copyright (problem
    reported by lintian).
  * The /etc/init.d/samba script now supports the force-reload
    argument, as required by the policy (problem reported by lintian).
  * Added a "rm /etc/cron.weekly/samba" at the end of the postinst.
  * Now the samba package can be installed even if no nmbd or smbd processes 
    are running. This fixes the following bugs: #8917, #9334, #10268, 
    #10411, #11146 and #13387.
  * Provides the original README in /usr/doc/samba. This fixes bug #9693.
  * Added a --no-reload option to sambaconfig to not reload Samba
    after configuration.
  * Created man pages for sambaconfig(8), addtosmbpass(8),
    mksmbpasswd(8) and nmblookup(1).
  * Corrected small typo in sample /etc/smb.conf.
  * Added two new parameters to /etc/smb.conf: "preserver case" and
    "short preserve case".
  * "rm -Rf /var/lock/samba" in postrm when package is being purged.
  * Patched upstream source (nmbd.c) to not overwrite log files when
    nmbd is called with the -a parameter (fixes #17704: nmbd ignores
    -a option).
  * /etc/init.d/samba now starts the nmbd daemon with the -a parameter
    to not overwrite log files.

samba (1.9.18p3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Oppsss!!! I really screwed it up (actually, debstd did).
    1.9.18p2-2 still contained man pages (smbmount and smbumount) part
    of other packages. This version does have this corrected. If not,
    I no longer deserve to be a Debian developer! So, this version
    fixes bug #18438 and some of the bugs I claimed to fix in
    1.9.18p2-2. Oh, by the way, I fixed the problem by running debstd
    with -m in debian/rules (man pages are installed by "make install"
    so it's a bad idea to re-install man pages with debstd).

samba (1.9.18p2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes bugs #18017, #17999, #17961, #17932: old 1.9.18p2-1 provided
    a man page for smbmount, which conflicts with package smbfs. This
    was solved by creating a multi-binary package that produces
    package samba and new package smbfsx.
  * Fixes bug #18000 (typo in postinst).
  * Fixes bug #17958 (postinst asks obsolete question). Actually,
    the question is still asked, but only if Samba is run as daemons.
  * Created a multi-binary package from the Samba sources: package
    samba and new package smbfsx which provides SMB mount utilities
    for kernels > 2.1.70.

samba (1.9.18p2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Removed /etc/cron.weekly/samba because Samba does not handle well
    rotation of log files (if the log file is rotated Samba will
    continue to log to the rotated file, instead of the just created
    one). In any case, Samba will rotate log files after an specific
    file size.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Jan 1998 22:34:27 -0400

samba (1.9.18p1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created a multi-binary package out of the Samba sources to provide
    packages samba and smbfsx (userland utilities to work with
    smbfs with kernels > 2.1.x.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Jan 1998 09:23:48 -0400

samba (1.9.18p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Created /etc/cron.daily/samba to save a copy of /etc/smbpasswd in

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 1998 13:40:56 -0400

samba (1.9.18alpha14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Added a note to the postinst script telling the user that he/she
    needs to run smbpasswd manually after creating a new /etc/smbpasswd
    from /etc/passwd.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Dec 1997 23:44:37 -0400

samba (1.9.18alpha13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Dec 1997 13:02:32 -0400

samba (1.9.18alpha12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Conflicts with the sambades package because the new Samba 1.9.18
    series do not depend on the DES libraries to support encrypted
    passwords.
  * Added parameter "encrypt passwords = yes" to /etc/smb.conf.
  * Compiled with support for quotas in disk_free().
  * Home directories are now exported read only by default.
  * Re-worked debian/rules.
  * Re-worked sample smb.conf.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Dec 1997 22:50:34 -0400

samba (1.9.17p4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Made /etc/smb.conf readable by everybody because some Samba utilities
    will fail otherwise when run by non-root users.
  * Dropped PAM support while the PAM libraries are ported to libc6.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Oct 1997 18:08:49 -0400

samba (1.9.17p3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Made /etc/smb.conf readable only by root as suggested by smbd's man page.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Oct 1997 09:21:25 -0400

samba (1.9.17p2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Running Samba as daemons instead of from inetd.
  * Removing netbios entries in /etc/inetd.conf.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Thu, 9 Oct 1997 23:37:25 -0400

samba (1.9.17p2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version that fixes a serious security hole.
  * Removed Debian patches added in 1.9.17-1 and 1.9.17p1-1 because
    these patches are now part of the upstream release.

 -- Eloy A. Paris <peloy@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Sep 1997 22:54:33 -0400

samba (1.9.17p1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Defined symbol _LINUX_C_LIB_VERSION_MAJOR as 6 in includes.h to shut up
    compiler warnings.
  * Included rpcsvc/ypclnt.h in includes.h to shut up compiler warnings.
  * Included crypt.h to have function prototype for crypt().
  * Included netinet/tcp.h to have some socket options included.
  * Included netinet/ip.h to have some socket options included.
  * Linking with libcrypt (LIBM='... -lcrypt'). Without including this
    library smbd generates a seg. fault when authenticating users (?).

 -- Eloy A. Paris <debian.org>  Wed, 10 Sep 1997 22:09:18 -0400

samba (1.9.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (called the "Browse Fix Release")
  * Added the option --oknodo to the start-stop-daemon invocation in prerm
    script. This was because the prerm was failing because start-stop-daemon
    was returning an error code if no nmbd or smbd daemons were found
    to kill.
  * The function yp_get_default_domain(), referenced in three source
    files was part of libc5 but with libc6 (glibc2) it has been moved
    to libnss_nis. Since the linker was unable to find the function
    I had to add LIBSM='-lnss_nis' to debian/rules.
  * Added -DNO_ASMSIGNALH and -DGLIBC2 to FLAGSM in debian/rules
    because compiling was failing because of conflicts with glibc2.
  * Patched source/includes.h to include termios.h if GLIBC2 is defined.
