# Upstream Samba is very strict about minimum versions of libraries, but allows
# looser checking using the --minimum-library-versions option to configure.
#
# This file allows overriding what upstream versions are considered
# equivalent to each other, so that this package can be built with older versions.
# Note that this just overrides the configure-level check, it does not mess with
# ABIs.
