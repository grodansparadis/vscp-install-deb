Type: boolean

 It is possible to migrate the existing configuration files from Samba 3 to
 Samba 4. This is likely to fail for complex setups, but should provide a
 good starting point for most existing installations.

Template: samba4/server-role
Type: select
Choices: domain controller, member, standalone, none
Default: domain controller
_Description: Server role
 Domain controllers manage NT4-style or Active Directory domains and
 provide services such as identity management and domain logons. Each
 domain needs to have a at least one domain controller.
 .
 Member servers can be part of a NT4-style or Active Directory domain but
 do not provide any domain services. Workstations and file or print servers
 are usually regular domain members.
 .
 A standalone server can not be used in a domain and only supports file
 sharing and Windows for Workgroups-style logins.
 .
 If no server role is specified, the Samba server will not be provisioned,
 so this can be done manually by the user.
