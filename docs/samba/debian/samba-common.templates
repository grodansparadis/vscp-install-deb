Template: samba-common/dhcp
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Modify smb.conf to use WINS settings from DHCP?
 If your computer gets IP address information from a DHCP server on the
 network, the DHCP server may also provide information about WINS servers
 ("NetBIOS name servers") present on the network.  This requires a
 change to your smb.conf file so that DHCP-provided WINS settings will
 automatically be read from /etc/samba/dhcp.conf.
 .
 The dhcp-client package must be installed to take advantage of this
 feature.

Template: samba-common/do_debconf
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Configure smb.conf automatically?
 The rest of the configuration of Samba deals with questions that
 affect parameters in /etc/samba/smb.conf, which is the file used to
 configure the Samba programs (nmbd and smbd). Your current smb.conf
 contains an "include" line or an option that spans multiple lines,
 which could confuse the automated configuration process and require
 you to edit your smb.conf by hand to get it working again.
 .
 If you do not choose this option, you will have to handle
 any configuration changes yourself, and will not be able to take
 advantage of periodic configuration enhancements.

 workgroup the system will appear in when used as a server, the default
 workgroup to be used when browsing with various frontends, and the domain
 name used with the "security=domain" setting.
