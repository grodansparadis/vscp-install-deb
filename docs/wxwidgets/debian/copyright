This package was debianized by Ron Lee <ron@debian.org> on
Sun, 13 Feb 2000 18:40:00 +1030.

More information about wxWidgets, as well as the source these debs
are produced from can be found at https://www.wxwidgets.org/

Note for Debian users:
======================

Most of the core wxWidgets library is licensed under the wxWindows Library
Licence (included below), however some additional features of the library
may include source licensed under terms which do not include the exception
permitting you to licence binary object code versions of works based on the
Library under terms of your own choice.  At any time and without warning,
newer versions of the Debian binary packages may include such code.

In short, if you plan to license apps built against these debs under terms
compatible with the GPL or LGPL, then you have nothing to worry about.  If
you wish to release your code under a licence which does not grant all of
the same rights as the LGPL would assert but would be permitted under the
terms of the exception, then you are strongly advised to either check the
licensing terms of all components that these debs (and all future versions
that you use) are built with, or build your own binaries of wxWidgets which
include only such code as is definitely covered by the exception.

You should presume that these debs will fall under the provisions of the
unmodified LGPL unless you can prove otherwise, however this note in no way
alters the actual terms of the authoritative licence detailed below, it is
intended to be purely informative of the fact that the Debian binary packages
will be built primarily with features useful to Free Software developers and
may not be suitable "as is" for compiling software for distribution that is
licensed incompatibly with the LGPL.  See /usr/share/common-licenses for
the full text of the LGPL.

Modifications and additions to the Library itself are encouraged to be
placed under the wxWindows Library Licence.  We hope you find it useful.

Preamble
========

The licensing of the wxWindows library is intended to protect the wxWindows
library, its developers, and its users, so that the considerable investment
it represents is not abused.

Under the terms of the wxWindows Licence, you as a user are not
obliged to distribute wxWindows source code with your products, if you
distribute these products in binary form. However, you are prevented from
restricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the
rights to use or distribute wxWindows library source code in the way
intended.

The wxWindows Licence establishes the copyright for the code and related
material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors
for this or derived code.

The core distribution of the wxWindows library contains files
under two different licences:

- Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public
  Licence, version 2, with the special exception that you may create and
  distribute object code versions built from the source code or modified
  versions of it (even if these modified versions include code under a
  different licence), and distribute such binaries under your own
  terms.

- Most core wxWindows manuals are made available under the "wxWindows
  Free Documentation Licence", which allows you to distribute modified
  versions of the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications
  made by you in your version of the library. However, you may not restrict
  any third party from reincorporating your changes into the original
  manuals.

All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."
