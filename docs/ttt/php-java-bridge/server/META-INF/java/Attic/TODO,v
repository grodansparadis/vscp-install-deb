@* Compared with the C based implementation this code is 2 to 10 times
slower. Identify the procedures which could be optimized.

* Unlike the C based implementation this implementation doesn't use
persistent connections to the Java back end. Especially on BSD based
OS this is noticeable. Check if pfsockopen can be used instead of
fsockopen and identiy the places which must be changed.

* This code doesn't implement override_redirect; java_session() must
be the first statement in a script. Add the code for
override_redirect.
